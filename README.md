# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Background and Overview of Analysis

Stakeholder has requested machine learning models that reduce bias in predicting credit risk using a credit card credit dataset from Lending Cluc, a peer-to-peer lending service company. 

Methodology: 
* Use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling
* Oversample using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
* Undersample using ClusterCentroids algorithm
* Combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm
* Compare BalancedRamdomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier

Deliverables: 
1. Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
2. Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
3. Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
4. A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis
